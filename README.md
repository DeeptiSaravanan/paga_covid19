# Single-cell sequencing - PAGA on COVID-19 Data

Computational Biology is the science of developing algorithms and training mathematical models to capture and analyze the different kinds of interconnections in biological data that might easily miss human eyes.

Single-cell sequencing refer to the sequencing of a single-cell genome or transcriptome. It could be used for multiple analyses like revealing complex and rare cell populations, modeling the erratic behavior of infected cells when compared to the healthy ones, trajectory construction for stem cell development, etc.

Given a biological data, various recently proposed models use statistical concepts for various downstream analysis. PAGA (Partition-based graph abstraction) is one of them which treats every cluster of cells as individual nodes and estimates the edge weight between these nodes (clusters) that could be used to analyze the various relationships and similar characteristics within and across clusters.

This repository contains the code (paga) and the COVID-19 data used for the implementation.
